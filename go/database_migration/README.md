# Database Migration

This example provisions an AWS Aurora SQL database and executes a database "migration" using the resulting connection info. This migration creates a table, inserts a few rows of data, and reads the data back to verify the setup. This is all done in a single program using an `inline` Pulumi program. With Automation API you can orchestrate complex workflows that go beyond infrastructure provisioning and into application management, database setup, etc.

To run this example you'll need a few pre-reqs:
1. A Pulumi CLI installation ([v3.0.0](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/get-started/install/versions/) or later)
2. The AWS CLI, with appropriate credentials.

Running this program is just like any other Go program. No invocation through the Pulumi CLI required:

```shell
$ go run main.go 
Created/Selected stack "dev1"
Installing the AWS plugin
Successfully installed AWS plugin
Successfully set config
Starting refresh
Refresh succeeded!
Starting stack destroy
